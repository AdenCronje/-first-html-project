// Welcome to CodeSpace Cafe!

// When we arrange pastries, we want them to look welcoming and show off each one at its best, similar to making code look good on a screen. It's important to place them so there's enough space around each one â€“ this makes each pastry stand out. We want our cafe to feel fun and welcoming, and our pastries should make everyone happy when they see them. Let's get ready and arrange these pastries beautifully, making something special one pastry at a time!

// #### What to Do

// 1. **Debugging Task:** Review the provided HTML and CSS code. Identify the CSS properties causing the pastries to overlap and adjust them to ensure proper spacing and layout. You should aim to position the pastries in a straight line on the counter, spaced evenly apart.
